# Aerofly Airports

This project contains data sets for airports and aircraft present in [Aerofly FS 4](https://www.aerofly.com/). This airport data is based on data from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/).

There is also a [ICAO code checker](https://fboes.github.io/aerofly-data/dist/), which checks if a given ICAO airport code exists in Aerofly FS 4.

It also contains [airport and navigation aid icons](./icons/) suitable for maps.

## Enclosed files

## Building

To generate a new list of all airports available in Aerofly FS 4:

1. Install this project  
   `npm install`
2. Download a list of all airports from https://ourairports.com/data/ to `tmp/airports.csv`.  
   `npm run fetch-csv`
3. Generate airport output files via:  
   `node ./get-airports.js 'C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Aerofly FS 4 Flight Simulator\scenery\airports_db'`
4. Generate aircraft output files via:  
   `node ./get-aircraft.js 'C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Aerofly FS 4 Flight Simulator\aircraft'`
